# Crescendo AI Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks for improving the Crescendo AI project. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] Implement a configuration management system using a config file instead of command-line arguments
2. [ ] Create a proper plugin architecture for sensors, relays, and audio players to make it easier to add new hardware support
3. [ ] Implement a state machine for managing system states (initializing, running, error, shutdown)
4. [ ] Separate the business logic from hardware interfaces more clearly
5. [ ] Implement a proper event system for communication between components
6. [ ] Create a web-based admin interface for remote configuration and monitoring

## Code Quality Improvements

7. [ ] Add type hints to all functions and methods
8. [ ] Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions
9. [ ] Add input validation for all public methods
10. [ ] Refactor the sensor data parsing to be more robust and handle different sensor formats
11. [ ] Implement a more robust USB device detection and connection mechanism
12. [ ] Add more comprehensive logging with different log levels
13. [ ] Implement a proper shutdown sequence that handles all resources correctly

## Testing Improvements

14. [ ] Create unit tests for all components (sensor, relay, main system)
15. [ ] Implement integration tests that test the interaction between components
16. [ ] Add automated tests for edge cases (e.g., sensor disconnection, relay failure)
17. [ ] Implement continuous integration with GitHub Actions or similar
18. [ ] Create a test coverage report and aim for at least 80% coverage
19. [ ] Add performance tests to ensure the system can handle long-running operations
20. [ ] Implement mock objects for all hardware dependencies to make testing easier

## Documentation Improvements

21. [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation for all classes and methods
22. [ ] Add a detailed system architecture document with component diagrams
23. [ ] Create a user manual with installation and usage instructions
24. [ ] Add troubleshooting guides for common issues
25. [ ] Document the hardware requirements and setup process in detail
26. [ ] Create a developer guide for contributing to the project
27. [ ] Add inline comments explaining complex algorithms and business logic

## Feature Enhancements

28. [ ] Add support for multiple audio tracks and playlists
29. [ ] Implement a schedule for playing different music at different times
30. [ ] Add support for different types of presence sensors
31. [ ] Implement volume control based on ambient noise levels
32. [ ] Add support for multiple zones with different music
33. [ ] Implement a REST API for external control and integration
34. [ ] Add support for streaming music from online services

## Performance and Optimization

35. [ ] Optimize the presence detection algorithm to reduce false positives/negatives
36. [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
37. [ ] Reduce memory usage by optimizing data structures
38. [ ] Implement more efficient audio file handling for large music libraries
39. [ ] Optimize startup time by lazy-loading components

47. [ ] Add a setup script for automatic installation and configuration
48. [ ] Implement a proper versioning system
49. [ ] Create Docker containers for easy deployment
50. [ ] Add support for different platforms (not just Raspberry Pi)
